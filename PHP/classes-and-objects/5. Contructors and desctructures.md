### Constructors / Destructors

The **new** keyword creates a new instance of the class. In addition, it runs a method called a constructor that we can use to initialize and configure the object. In PHP 5, constructors are named __construct().

*   __destruct() is a reserved method name for the class destructor
    *   If a class maintain an open file handler OR connection throughout its life, then the __destruct() method is a good place for a close-type operation.
*   __destruct() is called whenever an object is destroyed (When all its references are removed OR the end of the script) is reached.

Class name construct vs __construct;


```php
class A {
   function __construct() {
       echo 'New way construct';
   }
   function A() {
       echo 'old way construct';
   }
}
$aa = new A();
```


"New way construct" will be echoed. If you defined the __construct method after declaring A(). you will get results as follows

New way constract

**E_STRICT : **type 2048 -- Redefining already defined constructor for class A

NOTE: we can call the construct method anytime as we want. Ex:

```php
$aa = new A(); // old way construct

$aa->A();         //old way construct

$aa->A();        // old way construct
```

#### Don't call the destructor Explicitly

Well, as we can not call the constructor explicitly: we should not call the destructor explicitly.

This won't destroy the object and it is still valid PHP code.

```
$aa->__construct();
$aa->__destruct();
```
