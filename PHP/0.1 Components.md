# Why use components?

Other developers have already spent countless development hours creating, perfecting , and testing specialized components that do one thing really well. It's silly not to take advantage of these components to build better application more quickly instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel.

- guzzle/http - HTTP request and response

[HttpFoundation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/introduction.html) 	acts as a top-level layer for dealing with the HTTP flow.

- auro/router	-	Router

- onro/route	-	Router

- aws/aws-sdk-php	-	Amazon's S3 online storage service

- league/flysystem	-	Amazon's S3 online storage service

We can spend more time on solving our project's large objectives.


### What are components?

A component is a bundle of code that helps solve a specific problem in your PHP application.

Characteristics of the components

1.  Laser-focused - only to solve single problem very well.
1.  Small
1.  Cooperative - cooperates with other components to build larger application
1.  Well-tested
1.  Well-documented


### Components vs Frameworks

*   Framework does not contains all the required features
*   Integrating 3rd-party code into a framework is difficult because both of them probably don't share common interface.
*   Frameworks future needs to be concern
*   Not all the frameworks are bad


### Use component

**Packagist**	- place to find components

**Composer**	- installing components
