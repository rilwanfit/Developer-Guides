#Assertions
There are three default assertions that come out of the box with ScalaTest:
1. assert

```assert("Hello".length == 5, "Failure message")```

2. assertResult

This is used to differentiate between the expected value and the actual
```scala
test("one plus one with results") {
    val two = 2
    assertResult(two, "Failure message") { 1 + 1 }
}
```

3. intercept

helps when we want to test if a method throws an expected exception.
- It is equivalent of try/catch approach ### check BeanSpec for example
- if you want to deliberately fail a test, use ```fail("message")```. ```TestFailedException``` will be thrown
- Its is possible to cancel a tests ```cancel("I cancelled it deliberately")```. ```TestCancelledException``` will be thrown
- intercept does not provide a way to give failure message, so we need to wrapped with a ```withClue``` as follows:
```scala
withClue("Failure message") {
    intercept[IllegalArgumentException] {
        Binary("XYZ")
    }
}
```
