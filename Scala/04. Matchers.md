#Matchers

ScalaTest supports a domain-specific language (DSL) for expressing assertions in the test.

- this is achieved using the word ```should```
example: ```message should equal ("Hello World")```
- this is done by mixing in Matchers

```scala
import org.scalatest._
class BeanSpec extends FlatSpec with Matchers
```

- alternatively, members of the traits can be imported explicitly by
```import Matchers._```

- alternative to Matchers, we can mixin MustMatchers, which proves same syntax and meaning, but uses the verb ```must``` instead of ```should```

## Equality
1. message ```should``` be ("Hello World")
2. message ```shouldBe``` "Hello World"
3. message ```should``` equal ("Hello World")
4. message ```should``` === ("Hello World")
5. message ```shouldEqual``` "Hello World"

- ```message``` is a variable and can be any type.

## Instance and Objects
you can use ```be a``` or ```be an```

message ```shouldBe a``` [String]
message should not ```be an``` [String]

- Any type parameters will be erased on JVM, therefore, it's recommended to use underscore for type:
```name should be a [Seq[_]]```

- obj1 should be theSameInstanceAs obj2

## Size and Length
```message should have length 10```
```population should have size 100000```

## Strings
- startWith ("Hello")
- endWith ("rld")
- not include ("Batman")

-- possible to use regular expression
