Feature: decimal to binary conversion:

As a user, I want to convert a decimal number to a binary number:

Scenario 1:
Given I have a number A
When I convert this number to a binary number
Then, I get a binary equivalent B of the original decimal number

Scenario 2:
Given I have binary number X
When I convert this number to a decimal number
Then, I get a decimal equivalent Y of the original binary number

Scenario 3:
Given I have decimal number A
When I convert A to binary to get binary number B
And again convert B to decimal number C
Then A is equal to C
