## What are Git hooks?
Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: commit, push, and receive. Git hooks are a 
built-in feature - no need to download anything. Git hooks are run locally.

These hook scripts are only limited by a developer's imagination. Some example hook scripts include:

- pre-commit: Check the commit message for spelling errors.
- pre-receive: Enforce project coding standards.
- post-commit: Email/SMS team members of a new commit.
- post-receive: Push the code to production.

## How do git hooks work?
Every Git repository has a `.git/hooks` folder with a script for each hook you can bind to.
You're free to change or update these scripts as necessary, and Git will execute them when those events occur.

### How to create a PHP hook
#### 1. create pre-commit file with following content
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php
require("PreCommit.php");

$hook = new PreCommit();
$hook->run();
```

#### 2. Create PHP class PreCommit.php
```php
class PreCommit
{
    public function run()
    {
        echo "Hello Rilwan!";
    }
}
```

#### 3. move the files into `.git/hooks`
```bash
chmod +x pre-commit
mv pre-commit ~/.git/hooks/pre-commit
mv PreCommit.php ~/.git/hooks/PreCommit.php
```
> It is important to have `pre-commit` file to be executable.


## How we can bypass the hooks
```bash
git commit -n
git commit --no-verify
git push --no-verify
```
